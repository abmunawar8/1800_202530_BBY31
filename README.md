## Overview

Volunteering Made Easy is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users discover and volunteering opportunities. The app displays a curated list of volunteering listings, each with details such as location, skills required, and an image. Users can browse the list and mark their favorite listings for easy access later.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.
